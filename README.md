This is the first go at Adams Game Development System application



## Process

The application will need to be built around a gamestate. This means that each turn will be sequencial, and the game state will be iterative.
To start, this will be a two person game, with each person taking a turn one after the other. They will play with playing cards in a "War" type fashion.

This will allow us to get an idea of how to build this script, as its a very barebones version of what we are trying to build. Once we understand how the gamestate
interacts with the rest of the.
